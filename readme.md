# Context

Science has acquired a tremendous power through history, leading to give it a central place in many important decisions.
We may think about important wolrdwide topics, like agriculture, industrial production, climate change, or preservation of species, and how they heavily exploit scientific evidences to lead their debates.
Everyday tools, like smartphones, toys, or building materials, are conceived in large part based on scientific outcomes, and one cannot speak about the future without mentionning progress in science, like quantum mechanics or artificial intelligence.

But scientific research, despite its worldwide spreading, is not something anyone can do or access.
Research results are published in papers of several pages, often redacted for a given research audience, thus making it hard to read for a larger public.
They are mainly published through conferences and journals, which require a significant amount of financial and human resources to run.
One may will to pay for having reliable, high quality research, but anyone who has been involved in a "review-process" knows that this is not where the money flows.
Additionally, many researchers know that our current peer-review system is flawed by the publish or perish philosophy, with few reviewers for each paper and arguable expertise.

# Target Audience

We don't target here only traditionnal, professional researchers and alike, but any individual interested in research activities.
Thus, our audience is any individual who (i) want to find scientific answers to his questions and (ii) is ready to share his scientific knowledge with the rest of the world.
Anyone who recognise oneself in one of the following items may have interest in participating in this project:
- Publishing my research results through traditionnal publishers is too costly.
- Publishing my research results through traditionnal publishers is too long.
- Publishing my research results by myself makes it hard to ensure high quality.
- I reached a state where I doubt about the relevance of the peer-review system.
- Scientific knowledge should be as easy to access than Youtube videos.

# Problem

The main issues we would like to tackle are the current research inertia and costs, especially:
- for the public to access research results
- for researchers to access relevant references
- for researchers to share their results (with the public and other researchers)
- for researchers to get feedback (from the public and other researchers)

The challenge is to do so without lowering the quality of scientific research.
More precisely, it may be possible to produce research of lower quality, but it must at least be easier to produce and find research of high quality.
However, we are not trying to mitigate the "research quality" problem, which involves judgement and builds on heterogeneous criteria.
Rather, we want people to easily access information for understanding the research produced, the reasons why some consider it to be worth it, and the reasons why some consider it to be flawed.
Only in the light of this knowledge and one own's needs we assume that an individual can judge what to do with a given piece of research: exploit it or participate in its improvement.

# Proposal

To make scientific outcomes flow easily between people, we would like to exploit the naturally distributed architecture of the Internet.
This project thus attempts to support research activities in a distributed fashion, by using new technologies and the collaborative participation of Internet users.
Said another way, we want to offer an alternative way to access and publish research, which would not rely on the heavy, centralised processess offered by traditionnal publishers.

# How to Participate

This project is in its infancy so any help is welcome.

# Distributed vs. Traditionnal Research

Traditionnal research builds on the notion of *paper*, be it a blog post, a technical report, or an article in a conference or journal.
A paper, however, is rather complex in terms of structure, since it is supposed to be a somehow complete package, especially the peer-reviewed ones like in conference and journals.
It should indeed expose a needing context, present the state of the art with numerous references, highlight unanswered questions, propose answers, discuss them in the light of observations and data, and all of that through a rigorous method (not a [methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology), for those who did not know).
Such a thing cannot be achieved without a high level of expertise, which is why traditional publishing has achieved a great job in producing high quality outcomes.
However, this is also these high level requirements which make the production of a *paper* almost impossible for people who did not follow a proper formation.

Distributed research aims to break these requirements in small pieces, in order to dilute this complexity within a huge community and make it accessible to the population as a whole, with an emphasis on exchange and feedback.
Rather than having one or few experts working on all the fronts at once, we want to see interested people ask questions they really care about, expert people provide pieces of answers and references, willing people bring these pieces together in a consistent whole to produce answers, and methodic people stress each of these pieces to identify the aspects to improve.
Publishing such a product in a traditional way would be also painful, since finding the right conference or journal to publish to also requires knowledge about the relevant issues to consider, funds to go through the publication process, and months to wait for the publication to actually be available.
Distributed research, however, is about immediate publication: this is because you published it that other people were able to look at it and contribute.

Of course, if we dilute the complexity to make research producable from less expert people, we also dilute the level of expertise of such production, which is currently filtered out through traditionnal peer-reviews.
This is why distributed research should not be considered as a solution *against* traditional publishing, but something rather complementary to it, more like research towards and from the people.
While traditional research is mainly driven by high quality requirements (e.g. impact factor, H index), distributed research is driven by ease of access in terms of readability and production.
We want to offer an alternative to those who do not recognise themselves in the way traditional research is produced, although we share the same will to produce high quality, reliable scientific outcomes.
Rather than a centralised architecture, enforcing the focus on the most relevant outcomes only and requiring resource-consuming controls and competitive behaviours, we want to foster cheap controls and cooperative behaviours, where low quality research can be produced and easily improved through the participation of everyone.
