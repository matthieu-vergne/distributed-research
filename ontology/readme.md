# Research Ontology

An [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)) describes various concepts and their relationships in a formal way.
This directory contains our ontology about research, which describes the various research artefacts and activities we consider in this project.
This is the common ground of the project.
People not familiar with logical notations may start [here](formalisation.md) for a short explanation.

Currently, it is still a set of personnal notes, without proper discussion nor formal check.
Various references can be considered to revise and complete this ontology, among which:
- Almeida Biolchini, Jorge Calmon de, Paula Gomes Mian, Ana Candida Cruz Natali, Tayana Uchôa Conte, and Guilherme Horta Travassos. ‘Scientific Research Ontology to Support Systematic Review in Software Engineering’.
