# Research Ontology

This directory contains our [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)) of research, which describes the various research concepts we consider in this project and their relationships.
It provides the common ground of the project, with a terminology and formalisation of the research artefacts and activities we consider.

Currently, it is still a set of personnal notes, without proper discussion nor formal check.
Various references can be considered to revise and complete this ontology, among which:
