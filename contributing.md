# Contribution Guidelines

## Contributions

Anyone can participate at his own level by creating issues or pull requests to:
- propose ontologies about scientific research, in order to identify relevant research items to manage
- propose distributed architectures and design, in order for individuals to create, store, retrieve, update, and share these research items
- propose protocols of exchange, in order to share these research items between peers
- propose technologies, in order to implement concrete systems ready for use

These are the contributions we are seeking for, but any relevant contribution is welcome.

## Behaviours

We gladly accept any **peaceful** and **constructive** contribution.
By peaceful, we mean that the discussions must remain polite and respectful of the opinions of everyone.
By constructive, we mean that the topics discussed must be clearly related to this project and the individual messages should remain on topic.

We don't do surveillance nor censoring, we don't have time nor money for that, but we are responsible of this project and want to keep it on the right track.
So if noticing people does not suffice, we will have to close the discussions which do not respect these guidelines.
